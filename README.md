# Wild Skin v1.0.4
*Wild Skin* is a brown, tan, and orange theme built for the free forum software [ProBoards](https://proboards.com/). It features a left sidebar, sticky menu, and custom remodels for all major layout templates. It’s intended for use with an RPG set in a forest or wilderness biome. Built using my v5 theme base, [*cast*](https://github.com/elli-petersen/pbt-cast).

As a premade, *Wild Skin* is to be installed to your forum as is, or customized to suit your specific needs. You may edit any part of this skin as long as my credits remain **intact** and **visible**. It **may not** be used as a base for your own premade, claimed as your own, or picked apart for specific code. If you are interested in an individual remodel, please request it.

This is a design from 2013 and as such, will not be converted to work with ProBoards v6. It will be replaced with a fresh design to properly utilize new features in v6.

Be sure to review the [Readme PDF](wild-skin-readme.pdf) for the installation guide, additional information, and a zip containing all board images and relevant PSDs.

If you’re less familiar with ProBoards themes or CSS/HTML, I would suggest reviewing these resources before getting started.
