# Wild Skin v2.0.0
*Wild Skin* is a brown, tan, and orange theme built for the free forum software [ProBoards](https://proboards.com/). It features a left sidebar, sticky menu, and custom remodels for all major layout templates. It's intended for use with an RPG. Built using my v5 theme base, [*cast*](https://github.com/ellimccale/pbt-cast).

As a premade theme, *Wild Skin* is to be installed to your forum as is, or customized to suit your specific needs. You may edit any part of this theme as long as my credits remain **intact** and **visible**. It **may not** be used as a base for your own premade theme to distribute, claimed as your own work, or picked apart for specific code. If you are interested in an individual remodel, please request it.

This is a design from 2013 and will not be converted to work with ProBoards version 6. It will be replaced with a fresh design to utilize new features in v6.

If you're less familiar with ProBoards themes or HTML/CSS, I would suggest reviewing these resources before getting started.
